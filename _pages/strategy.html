<h1 class="mb-4">Digital Strategy</h1>
<p class="subheading">
  Having a solid digital strategy is essential if your project is to be
  successful. At Red Ant, we like to get to know our clients and offer our
  technical expertise when it comes to digital strategy, planning and
  facilitation.
</p>
<p class="subheading">
  Here are some of the key things our strategy team will look at when
  approaching a new project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Detailed knowledge of your company and how the different areas and
    departments work.
  </li>
  <li>
    In depth understanding of your target markets and how they wish to engage
    online – resulting in knowing what will work and what won’t work online.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recommendations on suppliers – we’ve worked extensively with suppliers and
    other partner agencies for SEO, sample fulfilment, hosting and more.
  </li>
  <li>Mobile First approach.</li>
  <li>
    Constant tracking that allows us to improve and adjust strategies moving
    forward.
  </li>
</ul>
