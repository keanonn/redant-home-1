<h1 class="mb-4">Design</h1>
<p class="subheading">
  Design and UX is a key part of what we do. It works best as an integral part
  of the overall process
</p>
<p class="subheading">
  You've probably got an idea of where you'd like to get to. Typically this
  might be a commercial version of your MVP. Something good enough to pay for.
</p>
<p class="subheading">
  To get to that point you're going to need quite a few things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>good project management,</li>
  <li>to make the right technical + product decisions,</li>
  <li>choose the right technology,</li>
  <li>and create a user experience that works.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subheading">
  You need a well rounded team that can work together to deliver each of those
  aspects.
